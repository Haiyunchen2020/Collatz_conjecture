# Collatz_conjecture

The Collatz conjecture concerns what happens when we take any positive integer n and apply the following algorithm: 
          n/2, if n is even 
n= {
            3*n+1, if n is odd
The conjecture states that when this algorithm is continually applied, all positive integers will eventually reach 1. For example, if n = 35, the sequence is 
35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
